Create environments here, in either the Role Ruby DSL (.rb) or JSON (.json) files. To install environments on the server, use knife.

For example, in this directory you'll find an example environment file called `example.json` which can be uploaded to the Chef Server:

    knife environment from file environments/example.json

For more information on environments, see the Chef wiki page:
